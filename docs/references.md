## Introduction

There are many general introductions to philosophy, and more come out every
year. Things to consider when looking for an introduction or reference work
in philosophy are: 

1. **For what level reader is the book written?**
Is it written for high school, the general (non-student) reader, for college,
for graduate students, or for professors? I will start the list with the 
easier, more basic texts and then suggest some higher level texts.

2. **What philosophical positions or biases does the book defend?**
This is important since many philosophers are
atheistic and their books ignore material pertinent to your studies. Also,
many introductions assume that contemporary debates are the best
introduction to philosophy, and so they largely ignore the history of
philosophy. I think this is a mistake for two reasons: first, contemporary
debates tend to be pretty technical, and they also have assumptions that
are often highly questionable to begin with, so the whole debate is not
helpful for beginners. Second, on the other hand, the history of 
philosophy shows us true geniuses at work dealing with problems in a
variety of ways, and these arguments have informed Western Civilization.
Accordingly, the books I will suggest emphasize the history of philosophy
and ignore much of the contemporary debate; moreover, if the books defend
a specific position (though they usually will not), they will at least
not be hostile to theism and the realist tradition of Aristotle and 
Aquinas.
