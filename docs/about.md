# About the CDP üìöüçØ

This labor is dedicated in its entirety to my friend Steve so that he (and hopefully others)
may find the truth and conform not only their minds but their full being to it.
It is an attempt to document all the Catholic materials that I have found fruitful in my own faith journey. 

It should give reasonable starting points for any person seeking Christ.
It is mainly a curation of things in the Catholic tradition with a focus on 
the intellectual tradition, which has shaped my life in many ways.

I am not an academic or a scholar. Just your average modern practicing Catholic who is trying to
document all of the information that I think *true*. I like to read, watch old movies, and
sometimes develop software.

Lastly I, like Pontius Pilate, find myself often asking 
the question "What is truth?"
