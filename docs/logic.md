# Logic

Here is the next step into some concepts that will help to think
more clearly. The most concise introduction to this field is done by Dr. Peter Kreeft and
I have typed up his most important two pages in that book.

Reading, re-reading, and then re-reading again the following snippet on logic will help you
in so many ways. But also follow the link below to buy that book and work at in chunks.

## All of logic in two pages: an overview
By Peter Kreeft in [Socratic Logic](https://www.staugustine.net/our-books/books/socratic-logic-3rd-edition/)

This is one of the shortest and simplest sections in this book, but it is also one
of the most important, for it is the foundation for everthing else in logic. If you
do not understand it clearly, you will be hopelessly confused later on. (It is 
explained in more detail in the next section, Section 5.)

The ancient philosophers defined Man as the "rational animal." To be human is
(among other things) to reason, to give reasons for believing things to be true.

We can see common forms, or structures, in all human reasoning, no matter what the 
contents, or objects, that we reason about. Logic studies those structures.

The fundamental structure of all reasoning is the movement of the mind from
*premises* to a *conclusion*. The conclusion is what you are trying to prove
to be true; the premises are the reasons or evidence for the truth of the
conclusion.

The two basic kinds of reasoning are *inductive* and *deductive*. Inductive
reasoning reasons from particular premises (e.g. "I'm mortal" and "You're mortal"
and "He's mortal" and "She's mortal"), usually to a more general or universal
conclusion (e.g. "All men are mortal"). Deductive reasoning reasons from at least
one general, or universal premise (e.g. "All men are mortal") usually to a more
particular conclusion (e.g. "I am a mortal"). Inductive reasoning yields only 
probability, not certainty. (It is not certain that all men are mortal merely on
the basis that four men, or 4 million, are.) Deductive reasoning, when corect,
yields certainty. (It is certain that if all men are mortal, and if I am a man, 
then I am mortal.)

A deductive argument succeeds in proving its conclusion to be true if and only if
three conditions are met. These are **the three check points of any deductive
argument.**

**(1) First, *all the terms must be clear* and unambiguous.** If a term is 
ambiguous, it should be defined, to make it clear. Otherwise, the two parties to
the argument may think they are talking about the same thing when they are not.

**(2) Second, *all the premises must be true.*** You can (seem to) "prove"
*anything* from false premises e.g. "All Martians are infallible, and I am a
Martian, therefore I am infallible."

**(3) Third, *the argument must be logically valid.*** That is, the conclusion
must necessarily follow from the premises, so that *if* the premises are true,
then the conclusion *must* be true.

(1) A "term" in logic is the subject or the predicate of a proposition (a 
declarative sentence). *Terms* are either *clear* or *unclear*. Terms cannot be
either true or false. E.g. "mortal" is neither true nor false. The *proposition*
"All men are mortal" is true, and the proposition "Some men are not mortal" is 
false.

(2) Propositions are declarative sentences. They are either *true* or *false*.
"True," in commonsense usage, means "corresponding to reality," and "false" means
the opposite. There is no one simple and infallible way of telling whether any
proposition is true or false.

(3) There is, however, a fairly simple and truly infallible way of telling
whether an argument is *valid* or *invalid*: the laws of logic, which you will
learn in this book.

A deductive argument is logically valid if its conclusion necessarily follows from
its premises, invalid if it does not. There are various forms of argument, and each
form has its own inherent rules for validity.

All the rules for each form of argument are natural to that form of argument and to
the human mind. If at any point in this book you think that any of its logical
flaws contradict what you already implicitly known by innate common sense, please
stop and check; for you must be misunderstanding either the laws of logic or what
you think common sense tells you, for *logic does nothing more than make explicit
the rules everyone knows innately by common sense.*

Arguments are made up of propositions (premises and a conclusion), and propositions
are made up of terms (subject and predicate). Terms are either clear or unclear.
Propositions (whether premises or the conclusion) are either true or false.
Arguments are either logically valid or invalid. Only terms can be clear or
unclear; only propositions can be true or false; only arguments can be logically
valid or invalid.

So **the three questions you should habitually ask** of yourself when writing or 
speaking, and of others when you are reading or listening to them, are:

**(1) Are the terms all clear and unambiguous?**
**(2) Are the premises all true?**
**(3) Is the reasoning all logically valid?**

If the answer to all three questions is Yes, then the conclusion of the argument
must be true.

So in order to **disagree with any conclusion, you must show that there is either
(1) an ambiguous term, or (2) a false premise, or (3) a logical fallacy** in the 
argument such that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
(You will soon learn the rules for judging that.) If you cannot do any of these
three things, then honesty demands that you admit that the conclusion has been
proved to be true. (All this applies to deductive arguments only; inductive
arguments do not claim certainty).
