When was the last time that you heard or expressed wonder to the degree that
Bryzgalov, an absolute unit, did in that video? In this particularly unique
period in human history where we can access information at our demand, I think
that this wonder is too easily overlooked if not outright lost.
What a dang shame that we have lost this almost childlike ability to wonder
which is most certainly and uniquely human.

**The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut in 1959**
*Ch. 5*
```

So why am I writing about hockey players wondering about the universe? Well,
because I truly believe that the universe is an awe filled mystery and I want
to instill in you the same wonder that I myself had lost. The same wonder that,
once rediscovered, impelled me to pursue answers to questions both ordinary and
ultimate. Make no mistake friend of my intentions. I want you to not only
wonder and honestly seek answers (let’s call this *truth* for now), but to also
follow where that leads, with a healthy amount humility and honesty. My favorite
literaly example of truth seeking at the moment comes from the “The Sirens of Titan”.
Where the main character, under great physical pain, incrementally wrote down
all that he knew to be true. It is a most fitting parallel for what I am trying to
inspire you to do, which is to pursue truth whatever the cost.

**The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis in 1942**
*Letter VIII*
Lewis gives a very interesting reflection on what he calls the 
Law of Undulation, which you might find interesting
```

It is this pursuit of truth that I have been engaged in for the past few years
of my life, as you well know. And I want to share with you this approach and
its resulting fruits that have enriched my life and helped me get through its
highs and lows. I know what you’re thinking. How the heck can we start from a
Flyers goalie to faith in Jesus Christ and his Church? 
The answer is, very carefully…

Let’s talk about a very particular issue that I ran across in my seeking.
It is important to speak about for two reasons. It is a direct roadblock to
the pursuit that I am advocating, and it gives an example on how to evalulate
claims. Since in this pursuit you will be evaluating many claims other than
this one. How many times have you heard the following declaritive sentence?
“Scientific knowledge gives us certain knowledge and will explain
all things”. Does this ring true to you? Before I learned how to evaluate
claims through the rules of inference it certainly did for me. I accepted this
(at least implicitly), lets call it, doctrine.

```{margin}
[**William Lane Craig Argument Against Scientism**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQL2YDY_LiM)
```
So, to the declaration of “scientism” above. I will ask you a couple of
questions in the hopes that they show the issues with the claim. Does that
statement represent scientific knowledge? Was that statement produced by the
scientific method? If your answer is yes, then I can’t help you, and you are being dishonest.
Return to start. Do not collect $200. If your answer is no, then
congratulations you just opened up your world to the laws of rational reflection.
The laws of inference and argument structure. The laws of logic. And my own
claim is that learning how to do this will not only help you to become a better
human being, we are the rational animal after all, but will also help you to
evaluate the claims of the Gospel.

**Dune by Frank Herbert in 1965**
*A quote from pg. 84*
“Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn.
And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn...
```

A quick aside, I truly don’t have an answer at the moment as to why I like many
others in this country did not learn the laws of logic in our schooling.
Learning how to learn as it were. The things that I am compiling here for you,
I hope prove useful for the others who share this experience. These are all of
the materials that I have used step by step to build up an entire worldview that
ends (or maybe begins) in believing the historicity of the Resurrection of
Christ among other *revealed truths*. Which only opened up to me in a fuller
sense after I learned how to learn. Let me reiterate that I am here to hopefully
give you a clear path to the Gospel and not just study philosophy for its own sake.
Although the latter is still certainly a worthy pursuit.

**John 3:12**
```

In case you need even more persuasion let’s not forget that there is someone
who strongly implied a connection between believing earthly natural things and
heavenly supernatural things. In other words, understanding the natural world
via rational reflection will then lay the foundation for you to pursue Christ
and listen to what he has revealed. These natural things we will put under the
domain of philosophy. These supernatural things we will put under the domain of
theology. And when taken together they form an overall worldview that is very
clearly, systematically, and consistently expressed in Catholicism.
And this is my hope for you friend. That you come to the truth of the Gospel
which is made known to us and the world by the Catholic Church. 
So that you can have the confidence of living a life with Christ.

**This field is called metaphysics**
St. Thomas Aquinas is my go to guy for this
```

To close off this section I’ll give you another instance of wonder
that I think you’ll identify with. The wonder over how strange it is to even
be alive. To be something rather than nothing.

```{epigraph}
And when we meet on a cloud.
I’ll be laughing out loud.
I’ll be laughing with everyone I see.
Can’t believe.
How strange it is to be anything at all.

-- Jeff Mangum, Neutral Milk Hotel
```

## Disillusionment

```{epigraph}
The disillusionments that we meet with here on earth are permitted precisely in order
to direct our thoughts more and more to this supreme beauty and impel us to love it.

-- Fr. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange
```
It is quite possible that you are not ready to trudge the path starting with wonder
that leads to Christ. Everyone is so unique so I can only adress what I know
from within my own lived experience. I can say that my disposition before
stumbling upon the path that we discussed was closer to disillusionment. Almost
like I was out of mana. And it is mainly through this avenue that I found the
need to ask ultimate questions, which led me onto the path above.

```{margin}
**The Confessions by St. Augustine of Hippo in ~397 AD**
... our heart is restless until it rests in you.
```

Life can be tough even if you have all of the things that the world tells you
will make you happy. It can sometimes seem like the things that we are doing
can be quite pointless. And I’ve come to learn that the answer to that
pointlessness isn’t what the world tells us we need. Which seems to be some
sort of mixture of medication, entertainment, and other novel experiences.
Why is it that we humans always seem to attempt to mitigate the symptoms and not
fully treat the root cause of our issues? What if the root of our manifest
issues are spiritual? What if modernity missed the mark in its understanding
of the human person? What if the answer to disillusionment is to not be
illusioned in the first place at all? What if the answer was and is Christ?
Is this wishful thinking on my part? Maybe. But do feelings have any bearing
on whether something is true or not? Most certainly not. Why did I just ask
seven question in a row? Because I’m an engineer trying to communicate.

Let me be blunt. The pursuit of truth isn’t easy. It isn’t filled with good
feelings and happy fun times all the time. The most difficult truths are the moral ones that
require you to give up vice and embrace virtue, my current struggle.
But like any good adventure you have to grind, go on quests, and meet fellow
adventurers along the way. But the experience gained and the potential reward
is too great to dissuade you from starting. The reward of having friendship
with God. If you are willing to give this a shot then keep going brother.

## Next Steps
Alright where do we go from here? One word for you, logic!

## Notes
My approach to communicating information is to use everything available that I find to be true.
Whether that comes from American authors, Catholic saints, or secular musicians.
If I only restricted myself to impeccable perfect people then I don't think I could
ever quote anyone. St Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologiae is my model for this.
