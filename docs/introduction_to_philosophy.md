When is the last time that you have heard or even expressed wonder to the degree that
Ilya Bryzgalov did in that video? In this particularly unique period in human history
where we can access *truths* at our demand, I think that this wonder is too easily
overlooked if not outright lost. What a dang shame that we have lost this almost child like wonder that is most certainly
and uniquely human.

So why are you here reading me write about hockey players wondering about the universe?
Well, because I truly believe that the universe is an awe filled mystery and I want
to instill in you the same wonder that I myself had lost. The same wonder that also
led me back to Christ. I understand that that is quite a big and seemingly absurd jump.
After all how can someone go from a flyers hockey goalie to complete faith in Jesus Christ and his church?
The answer is ... very carefully.

epistemoloy is the study of knowing and how we know it
```
In order to convince you that the pursuit of truth is a worthy one, we will go through
a very particular and popular attitude towards knowledge. And show how we know with
certainty that it is false. It is a strong claim regarding knowledge
and what can be known and the first time I came across this *doctrine*, as it were, 
I remember not really having a problem with it. It seemed to make sense to my untrained
and tech focused mind. It is only after very careful reflection and hearing arguments did
I really come to see the absurdity.

"Scientific knowledge is the only true type of knowledge."

I've heard this line from many people thoughout my life as I am sure that you have as well.
But what an odd thing to say right? Because if that were true then that particular 
statement could not also be true. Because that claim itself was not produced
by the scientific method.
Does this mean that there needs to be an extra-scientific vantage point
that has to put things together? And is that vantage point called philosophy?
The point of looking at this particular statement and posing these questions isn't to 
give you the answer, but inspire you to seek the tools to answer it for yourself.
Yet further, are there tools of thought that we can use to explore any proposition
and not just the one above?

At this point in the journey I want you to realize that there exists
a way of thinking that can help sort through propositions and claims 
and this way of thinking can be studied in logic.

If you are like me and feel that you don't think well or clearly about certain things
then read on. I have compiled all of the materials that have helped me 
step by step build up an entire worldview that ends (or maybe begins) in believing the historicity of
the resurrection of Christ among many other *revealed truths*. This worldview starting 
with wonder and laws of logic.

Make no mistake my friend
I am here to show you the message of the Gospel and not just study philosophy for its own sake.
Although the latter is still certainly a most worthy pursuit, I'll leave its instruction to more capable men.

**John 3:12**
```

Let's not forget that there is someone who strongly implied a connection between
believing earthly things and believing natural things.
In other words understanding the natural world via rational reflection will then lay the foundation for you to pursue Christ.
These natural things we will put under the domain of philosophy. These supernatural things we will put under
the domain of theology. And together they form an overall worldview that we will call Catholicism.

And this is my goal friend. To teach you about Catholicism and the message of the Gospel.
So that you can have the confidence of living a life with Christ.

The study of this is under the domain of *metaphysics*
```
If Bryzgalov's wonder didn't fire you up enough, let me leave you with one of the better
modern songs that I have heard that express that same wonder. The wonder over how 
strange it is to even be alive. To be something rather than nothing.

```{epigraph}
And when we meet on a cloud.
I'll be laughing out loud.
I'll be laughing with everyone I see.
Can't believe.
How strange it is to be anything at all.

-- Jeff Mangum, Neutral Milk Hotel
```

## Disillusionment

```{epigraph}
... our heart is restless until it rests in you

-- St. Augustine, The Confessions
```

It is possible that you are at a different stage of life and are experiencing
a disposition that can be more accurately described as disillusionment.
It is mainly through this avenue that I myself found the need to look for deeper answers to my life and started asking
the ultimate questions, which led me deeper into theology.

Life can be tough even if you have all of the things that the world tell you will make you happy.
It can sometimes seem like the things that we are doing can be 
quite pointless. And the answer to that pointlessness 
isn't what the world tells us we need. Which seems to be some sort of mixture between
medication, entertainment, and other novel experiences. Why is it that we always
seem to attempt to mitigate the symptoms and not fully treat the root cause of 
our issues? It seems to be a universal human trait to be reactive rather than proactive.

Why not entertain the possibility that a potential solution
is a relationship with the God that created you? 
Wishful thinking? Maybe. Do our feelings have any bearing on whether something is true or not?
Most certainly not. If you are willing to give this a shot then keep reading friend.
And I am here to tell you that wonder seems to be 
a sort of antitode to this type of feeling. How can you be depressed over the world if you 
are just in awe over it. It seems to be that once we perceive that we have a full intellectual grasp
on any thing or aspect that it ceases to amaze us. Good thing that the world is much more mysterious
than we think.

## Next Steps

Alright what have we gone over? Well we have framed some dispositions namely *wonder* and *disullisionment* and are now
going to take a detour into *logic*. This will help us to explore
ourselves, the world around us, and eventually come to a deeper knowledge of truth. Any with careful 
discernment we may even come to understand the message of the Gospel, which is that truth is a person...
