The following is a list of basic terms which are fundamental to learning
philosophy. 

```{glossary}
Philosophy
   love or pursuit of wisdom; a quest for truth through logical inference
   to necessary principles rather than factual observation.

Mythos-Logos
   represents the birth of philosophy; before Thales, people explained the world
   through myths, afterward they employed reason.

## Branches of Philosophy
```{glossary}
Metaphysics
   study of "being *qua* being", of reality behind appearance, or the ultimate
   principle behind things.

Epistemology
   study of theory of knowledge, of what can we know and how we can know it.

Ontology
   the theory of being, of what kinds of things exist.

Logic
   the theory of proper argumentation. It judges if an argument is valid or faulty.
   It asks: Do the premises lead to the conclusion? But not: Are the premises
   right or wrong?

Ethics
   discipline that deals with what is morally good or bad, right or wrong in
   human behavior. Asks: How should a person act?

Natural Theology
   our knowledge of God based solely on reason, as opposed to revealed
   theology, which relies on Scripture; hence, **Faith and Reason** are the two
   ways by which we can know truth about many philosophical topics. Related to
   this are:
   * **Ontological argument**: the argument for God's existence based on the kind
   of being God is: God is a perfect being, hence He must exist, else He is not 
   Perfect.
   * **Cosmological argument**: the argument for God's existence based on the fact
   that the existence of the universe is not self-explanatory and so needs to 
   have been created.

## Basic Ways to Describe Reality
```{glossary}
Materialism
   theory that affirms that physical matter is the only reality through which all
   being and processes and phenomena can be explained, ex. Atomism

Idealism
   theory that affirms that reality is primarily composed of ideas or minds;
   ideas are the most real and the material world less real, ex. Plato

Monism
   metaphysical view that there is only one kind of substance or ultimate
   reality; everything that exists is made of variations of one single element
   or principle, ex. Thales(water)

Dualism
   theory that divides the world into two mutually irreducible elements, ex.
   Plato(world of Forms/material world)

Pluralism
   metaphysical theory that the world is composed of many kinds of ultimate 
   reality or elements, ex. Aristotle

Cosmology
   philosophical study of the external universe (not of man's place in the
   universe)

Nominalism
   the belief that universals exist in name alone, thus denying the existence of
   Forms or natures

Ockham's Razor
   the notion that entities should not be multiplied without necessity, or that
   the simplest explanation is the best
```

## Epistomology
**(how we know reality)**
```{glossary}
Rationalism
   the belief that truth or knowledge can be known only through reason,
   and not through sense experience, ex. Plato

Empiricism
   the belief that truth or knowledge can be known only through sense experience;
   ex. Aristotle

Relativism
   theory that there is no objective truth, but just different perceptions and
   interpretations. Questions of right/wrong or true/false differ according
   culture and people

Subjectivism
   a type of relativism in which truth is determined by each person's (as 
   opposed to each culture's) perceptions of the world

Skepticism
   the belief that there is no truth or that we cannot know the truth

Scientism
   the assummption that the only valid knowledge is derived from the
   scientific method, that is, the ordered observation of the material world
   which enables us to control that world

Innate Ideas
   these are associated with rationalism, the ideas we can know independently of
   any experience; also called *a priori* knowledge

Tabula Rasa
   the idea associated with empiricism which states that the human mind begins
   as a "blank slate" lacking any innate ideas. Ideas come to the mind through
   experience, either external sense experiences or internal reflective
   experiences; also called *a posteriori* knowledge

The Principle of Non-contradiction
   the fundamental logical principle behind all reasoning which asserts that
   nothing can be and not-be simultaneously (or, the same proposition cannot be
   simultaneously affirmed and denied).
```

## Human Nature and Ethics
```{glossary}
Philosophical anthropology
   the philosophical study of human nature

Psychology
   the study of the soul (Greek: psyche) as the principle of life and activity

Sensible
   that reality which is known by the senses, i.e., the material, perceivable
   world

Intelligible
   those aspects of reality that are not sensible, but are known by means of the
   intellectual grasp of higher realities

Will
   the faculty or power of humans to move themselves to action, as opposed to
   reacting on instinct; for Aquinas, this is the "rational appetite"

Freedom
   the idea that actions are not caused by an agent other than the one acting

Determinism
   the opposite of freedom; the idea that actions are caused or determined by
   something outside of one's direct control

Contingent
   Any event that did not *have to happen*

Necessary
   that which cannot be otherwise than it is
```

## Plato and Aristotle
**(founders of philosophy)**
```{glossary}
Justice(Plato)
   Virtue of the whole person through which reason controls the appetites
   with the help of the spirited part of the soul

Forms
   For Plato and Aristotle, the metaphysical principle determining what
   something is, and the object that is known, since it is behind or apart
   from the material world of change

Categories
   For Aristotle, the ten ways in which Being is said to really exist;
   the primary division is between substances, the subject of all
   predication, and the variable accidental categories

Substance
   for Aristotle, substance is matter plus form; the basic unit of 
   existence

Accident
   qualites of a substance which exist IN a substance and, if changed, do
   not change the substance itself

Hylomorphism
   the idea that all beings are made of two inseparable principles,
   form (the what) and matter (the stuff)

Act and Potency
   Aristotelian manner of explaining possibility for change. Form
   determines what something is (principle of actuality); potency is
   what can be, and is associated with matter's capacity to take on
   different forms.

Teleology
   Aristotle's principle that all natures act for the sake of an end or
   goal; hence all reality is goal directed

Four Causes
   1. **material** cause: stuff from which something is made
   2. **formal** cause: "shape" of what it is
   3. **efficient** cause: outside force which brings substance into being
   4. **final/end** cause: purpose for which something exists
