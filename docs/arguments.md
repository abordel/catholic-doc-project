# Arguments for the Existence of God

I've come across many arguments for and against the existence of God.
I thought it useful to compile them here along with their different versions
by different thinkers.

## The Argument from Contingency

````{tabbed} St. Thomas Aquinas
   From The Summa Theologiae Prima Pars

   The third way is taken from possibility and necessity, and runs thus. We find in nature things
   that are possible to be and not to be, since they are found to be generated, and to corrupt,
   and consequently, they are possible to be and not to be. But it is impossible for these always to 
   exist, for that which is possible not to be at some time is not. Therefore, if everything is possible
   not to be, then at one time there could have been nothing in existence. Now if this were true, even now
   there would be nothing in existence, because that which does not exist only begins to exist by something
   already existing. Therefore, if at one time nothing was in existence, it would have been impossible for anything
   to have begun to exist; and thus even now nothing would be in existenceâ€“which is absurd. Therefore, not all beings
   are merely possible, but there must exist something the existence of which is necessary. But every necessary thing
   either has its necessity caused by another, or not. Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary things which
   have their necessity caused by another, as has been already proved in regard to efficient causes. Therefore we cannot but
   postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not receiving it from another, but rather
   causing in others their necessity. This all men speak of as God.

````{tabbed} Trent Horn
    From Answering Atheism

    P1. Everything that exists has an explanation for its existence in itself
    or in something outside of itself.

    P2. The universe does not have an explanation for its existence in itself.

    C1. Therefore, the universe has an explanation for its existence outside of itself.

    In the above argument, premise one and two support the conclusion, that the universe
    has an explanation outside of itself. That conclusion is then joined to another premise
    and yields the final conclusion:

    P3. Any explanation outside of the universe is God.

    C2. Therefore, God exists.
