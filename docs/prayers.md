# Prayers

There are some core prayers that I think are a good idea to learn.

## Our Father
```{margin}
**Matthew 6:9**

**Luke 11:2**

The only times in scripture where Jesus taught anyone how to pray
```
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come.
Thy Will be done,
on earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

Amen

## Hail Mary
```{margin}
**Luke 1:28**
```
Hail Mary,
Full of Grace,
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary,
Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of our death.

Amen

## Glory Be

Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning,
is now,
and ever shall be,
world without end.

Amen

## The Memorare

Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone
who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was
left unaided.

Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother;
to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of
the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me.

Amen

## Prayer to St. Michael
St. Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.
Be our protection  against the wickedness and snares of the Devil.
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,
and do thou,
O Prince of the heavenly hosts,
by the power of God,
cast into hell Satan,
and all the evil spirits,
who prowl about the world
seeking the ruin of souls.

Amen
