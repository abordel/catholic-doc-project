# The Catholic Documentation Project

## About
This is an effort to document all of the materials in the Catholic Tradition that have informed my worldview.
I am a humble software developer by day who has gotten really into scholastic metaphysics by night.

## Built With
The Sphinx Document Generator (I use this alot at my day job)
The sphinx book theme (awesome theme and project)
readthedocs (excellent hosting service)

## Getting Started
If you my fellow coder would like to take a break and read some very interesting claims about the world go ahead and check out the 
build here
[tcd](https://tcdp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

If you are not interested in that there should still be some value in checking out the project to see how to
use the sphinx document generator with read the docs.
